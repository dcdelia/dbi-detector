In this sample, a memory buffer is first allocated with
PAGE_READWRITE protection and the block code is copied to it.
The protection is then changed to PAGE_GUARD with PAGE_EXECUTE_READ
and the block is executed. Normally, an EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE
will be generated.

Pin passes this test, but DR does not (crashes).
