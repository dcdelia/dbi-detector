The idea beyond this sample is that SMC handling must not lead to forgetting a PAGE_GUARD protection
associated with a block.

Note: both Pin and DR seem to have difficulties with handling PAGE_GUARD protection even without
SMC. So in a way, this sample is already unnecessarily complex for what they can do.

Pin: Fails, because EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE never comes.
DR: Crashes.
