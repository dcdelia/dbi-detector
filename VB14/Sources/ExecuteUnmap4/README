In this sample, a memory buffer is first allocated with
PAGE_READWRITE protection and the block code is copied to it.
The protection is then changed to PAGE_GUARD with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE
and the block is executed. Normally, an EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE
will be generated.

Both Pin and DR pass. Note that this test differs from ExecuteUnmap3 only
in the extra WRITE protection.
