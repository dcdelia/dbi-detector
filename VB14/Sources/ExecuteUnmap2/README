This sample tests whether the DBT framework can handle addition
of the PAGE_GUARD protection to a PAGE_EXECUTE_READ page that
already holds a block.

Both Pin and DR fail because the EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE is not
generated, most likely because the original block is not
invalidated when the page protection changes.
