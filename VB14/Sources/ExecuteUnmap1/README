In this sample, a simple basic block is first created and then
the underlying page is remapped as PAGE_NOACCESS. The idea
is that the block should be invalidated so that when its
execution is attempted for the second time, it is not found
in the block cache and needs to be recreated, this time
taking the new page protection into account.

Both Pin and DR fail, because they apparently do not
invalidate the block or just do not pay attention to
the new protection of the page.
