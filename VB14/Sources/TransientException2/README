The idea beyond this sample is that if two blocks are associated with a page with the PAGE_GUARD
protection, the consumation of the guard page by the first executed block must lead to a behavior
in which the second block does not generate the exception.

Note: both Pin and DR seem to have difficulties with handling PAGE_GUARD protection.
So in a way, this sample is already unnecessarily complex for what they can do.

Both Pin and DR fail, because EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE never comes upon the execution
of the first block and so there is nothing to consume.
