This sample demonstrates the complexity of virtualizing the instruction pointer
properly within the DBT framework. Instructions like FXSAVE, FNSAVE, FNSTENV
save FPU state to memory buffer, including the EIP of the last FPU instruction.

SF2 passes as expected.
DR passes. (But would fail if this was an FXSAVE).
Pin fails.
