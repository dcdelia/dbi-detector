This case is a modified ExecuteUnmap1 sample. The difference
is that the buffer for the block is directly allocated as
PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE. After the block is created, the page
is again remapped as PAGE_NOACCESS.

The idea is that the block should be invalidated so that when its
execution is attempted for the second time, it is not found
in the block cache and needs to be recreated, this time
taking the new page protection into account.

DR continues to fail in the same way as in the ExecuteUnmap1 case,
but Pin behaves differently. The guest exits with ACCESS_VIOLATION.
